Description:
This program converts CG masterVar file to VCF file v4.1.  This version (rev1) fixes a bug that may cause a buffer over flow problem in some samples.

The input format is the CG masterVar file. It has some lines for meta-information and one headline. There could be empty fields (two or more "\t" together) in the masterVar file.

This is an example of the masterVar file:

#ASSEMBLY_ID    GS19240-1100-37-ASM
#.....
#TYPE   VAR-OLPL

The output will be in VCF file (v4.1) that contains all the information in the masterVar file.

Build:
The source code is written in C. You need to build the executable code using the Makefile included here. To build the executable, you need to put the Makefile and the source C code
into the same directory and type:
make

The executable code should be built appropriately and ready to use.

Usage:
If you type only the command "masterVar2VCFv41", the usage will appear:

-bash-3.1$ ./masterVar2VCFv41
Usage: masterVar2VCFv41 input_masterVar(tsv or tsv.bz2) reference_file(fa.bz2) output_VCF_file

Input files:
The input files are masterVar file, which can be in tsv or tsv.bz2 format; the reference file required should be in fa.bz2 format. You can download the refernece from here:
ftp://ftp.completegenomics.com/ReferenceFiles/
Make sure that you use the fa.bz2 files, NOT the crr files.

Output file:
The output file has all the information that are in the original masterVar file. It only contains the record that are variations in the original masterVar. Anything that is either complete
homozygous reference or complete no-calls are not recorded in the output file in this version.

More information:
You can validate your VCF file using vcftools. More information about vcf file (version 4.1) can be found here:
