#Variant tools schema version 1.0
#
# - The first line is required
# - Lines starting with # and ; are comments
# - Inline comments starts with ;

# - Required sections:
#
#   [linked fields]:
#		A database can provide one or more sets of linked fields by which it is linked
#		to the master variant table of the project. Each line should have format
#	        
#	        build=field1,field2,...
#
#	    where build is the build of a reference genome, or '*' if this annotation database
#	    can be linked to project with any referenge genome. One or more fields can be
#	    specified as 'linked fields':
#
#	    1. for 'variant' annotation database, they should be
#	       names of chr, pos, ref, and alt fields.
#	    2. for 'position' annotation database, they should be
#		   names of chr and pos fields.
#		3. for 'range' annotation database, they should be names of
#		   chr, start pos and ending pos fields.
#		4. for 'field' annotation database, they should be names of fields
#		   that link to the master variant table.
#       
#   [data sources]: This section can have keys
#       * description: description of the database
#       * anno_type: can be one of 'variant', 'position', 'range' or 'field'
#       * direct_url: URL to download annotation database directly. This is only
#           used for sqlite projects.
#       * source_type: type of source files, we currently only supported
#           tab based text file (txt)
#       * source_url: where to download source file.
#       * source_pattern: pattern of source files (used to exclude README etc)
#       * version: version of the database, which is not necessarily version 
#         of the data source. The convension is sourceVersion_dbVersion. If
#         unspecified, vtools will try to get it from filename. For example, 
#         dbNSFP-1.1_0.db will have version number 1.1_0.
# 
#   fields sections for the fields that will be imported.
#       * index: 1-based index of the index of the column in the database
#       * type: can be "chromosome", "0-based position", "1-based position",
#               and SQL allowed types such as "DECIMAL(7,6) NOT NULL"
#       * null (optional) if specified, value that will be treated as NULL.
#       * comment (optional) a description of the field
