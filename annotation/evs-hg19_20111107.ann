[alt]
index=4
type=CHAR(1) NOT NULL
comment=Variant alternate allele.

[ref]
index=5
type=CHAR(1) NOT NULL
comment=Reference allele.

[EuropeanAmericanAltCount]
index=6

[AfricanAmericanAltCount]
index=8
type=INTEGER NOT NULL
comment=The observed alt allele counts for the African American population. Allele counts only include genotypes with quality >= 30 and read depth >= 10. 

[AfricanAmericanRefCount]
index=9
type=INTEGER NOT NULL
comment=The observed ref allele counts for the African American population. Allele counts only include genotypes with quality >= 30 and read depth >= 10. 

[AllAltCount]
index=10
type=INTEGER NOT NULL
comment=The observed alt allele counts for all populations. Allele counts only include genotypes with quality >= 30 and read depth >= 10. 

[AllRefCount]
index=11
type=INTEGER NOT NULL
comment=The observed ref allele counts for all populations. Allele counts only include genotypes with quality >= 30 and read depth >= 10. 

[EuropeanAmericanMaf] 
index=12
type=FLOAT NOT NULL
comment=The European American minor-allele frequency in percent.

[AfricanAmericanMaf] 
index=13
type=FLOAT NOT NULL
comment=The African American minor-allele frequency in percent.

[AllMaf] 
index=14
type=FLOAT NOT NULL
comment=The minor-allele frequency in percent for all populations.

[AvgSampleReadDepth]
index=15
type=INTEGER NOT NULL
comment=The average sample read depth.

[Genes]
index=16
type=VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
comment=One or more genes for which the SNP is in the coding region (CCDS). 

[GeneAccession]
index=17
type=VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
comment=NCBI mRNA transcripts accession number.

[FunctionGvs]
index=18
type=VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
comment=The GVS functions are calculated by the Exome Variant Server; they are based on the alleles for all populations and individuals; the bases in the coding region are divided into codons (if a multiple of 3), and the resulting amino acids are examined.

[AminoAcidChange]
index=19
type=VARCHAR(20)
comment:The corresponding amino acid change for a SNP. 

[ProteinPos]
index=20
type=VARCHAR(20)
comment=The coresponding amino acid postion in a protein relative to the whole protein length. 

[cDNAPos]
index=21
type=INTEGER
comment=The coresponding cDNA postion for a SNP. 

[ConservationScorePhastCons]
index=22
type=FLOAT
comment=A number between 0 and 1 that describes the degree of sequence conservation among 17 vertebrate species; these numbers are downloaded from the UCSC Genome site and are defined as the "posterior probability that the corresponding alignment column was generated by the conserved state of the phylo-HMM, given the model parameters and the multiple alignment" (see UCSC description). 

[ConservationScoreGERP]
index=23
type=FLOAT
comment=The rejected-substitution score from the program GERP, a number between -11.6 and 5.82 that describes the degree of sequence conservation among 34 mammalian species, with 5.82 being the most conserved; these scores were provided by Gregory M. Cooper of the University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences to the EVS project. 

[GranthamScore]
index=24
type=INTEGER
comment=Grantham Scores categorize codon replacements into classes of increasing chemical dissimilarity based on the publication by Granthan R.in 1974, Amino acid difference formula to help explain protein evolution. Science 1974 185:862-864.

comment=Prediction of possible impact of an amino acid substitution on protein structure and function based on Polymorphism Phenotyping (PolyPhen) program. 

[ChimpAllele]
index=27
type=CHAR(1)
comment=Chimp alleles are acquired from UCSC human/chimp alignment files. If the variation does not fall within an alignment block, or if it is an indel, the chimp allele is listed as "unknown". If the variation falls within a gap in the alignment, it is listed as "-". 

[ClinicalLink]
index=28
type=VARCHAR(100)
comment=The potential clinical implications associated with a SNP (limited). 

[FilterStatus]
index=29
type=VARCHAR(25)
